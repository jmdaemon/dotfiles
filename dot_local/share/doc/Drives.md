## Power Outages

Power outages can play a big role in the lifespan of your hardware.
Having a UPS is one way to protect your hardware and data against power surges or power outages.

### UPS

A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) allows you to continue using your computer in case of
a power outage. A UPS protects the lifetime of your hardware against sudden power outages,
and protects your data from corruption and data loss.

## SSD

A solid state drive is similar to a HDD with the exception of the following:
- SSDS have faster reads/writes than HDD.
- SSDS are also generally more expensive.
- SSDS don't yet come in huge sizes (and if they do, expect to pay a premium).

Pros:
    - Good for booting up from (Fast to read)
    - Good for loading games/applications from (Due to the fast reads).
    - Better than HDDs for any kind of file disk access case.

Cons:
    - Potential for slowdown if you abuse the drive with too many writes.

## HDD

A hard disk drive is a standard storage medium. HDDs:
- Come in huge sizes of up to 10TB
- Are cheaper than SSDs.

Pros:
    - Good for backups (If you have a lot to store).

### Adata RTS5763DL J2E76P2 GJ21AA

Friend reviewed this drive

- Part number on the controller chip is a usb chip?
- Questionable reliability?
- Lifespan of about 2 years?
    - This could've been due to personal circumstances (power outage)
