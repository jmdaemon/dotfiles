## Power Outages

Power outages can play a big role in the lifespan of your hardware.
Having a UPS is one way to protect your hardware and data against power surges or power outages.

### UPS

A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) allows you to continue using your computer in case of
a power outage. A UPS protects the lifetime of your hardware against sudden power outages,
and protects your data from corruption and data loss.
